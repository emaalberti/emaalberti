# Hi there, I'm Emanuele  

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I'm currently pursuing a Double Master's Degree in Computer Science Engineering & Data Science between Politecnico di Milano and Politécnica de Madrid.  
My main interests revolve around Data Science, NLP, and Machine Learning, with a focus on applying AI to real-world problems.

## Projects
Here are some highlights of my academic, professional, and open-source work:  

- [Gwen2.5-3B-SFT-GRPO](https://github.com/emaalberti/Gwen2.5-3B-SFT-GRPO)  
  Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-3B to reason step by step on competitive coding tasks.  
  Achieved strong results in LiveCodeBench using few GPU resources with GRPO fine-tuning.  

- [QualityCheckDevNut](https://github.com/emaalberti/QualityCheckDevNut)  
  NLP pipeline developed during my work at DevNut (2025) to assess and validate LLM outputs,  
  improving robustness of web applications and reducing system failures by 30%.  

- [St_Gallen_Hackathon](https://github.com/emaalberti/St_Gallen_Hackathon)  
  Hackathon project: website + ML model to classify satellite fire pictures in Brazil.  

- [AppliedStatistics](https://github.com/emaalberti/AppliedStatistics)  
  Repository of assignments and projects from the Applied Statistics course.  

- [Forked Projects](https://github.com/emaalberti?tab=repositories&type=fork)  
  Contributed to and customized several open-source projects.  
  These forks represent both my learning journey and extensions of my own projects.  

Other professional/academic highlights:  
- Automation Tool for Datapizza (2023) – Google Cloud app to automate candidate data extraction (Python + JS) --> Private Repo
- Societal Impact of Ozempic (UIS Research, 2025) – Large-scale Reddit NLP analysis presented at the Italian Embassy --> Incoming...
